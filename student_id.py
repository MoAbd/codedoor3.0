Every student has a local id, which is his index in the class If we sort it alphabetically, and a global id which is its index among the school. IDâ€™s always start from 1. Given a list of numbers of students in each class, and the global id of a student. what is the local id of that student?

Input Format

N(student global id) M(Number of classes)
A space seperated list of number of students in each class

Constraints

1 <= N < total number of students
1 <= M < 1000
1 <= number of students in a class < 1000

Output Format

a single number containing the student local id
